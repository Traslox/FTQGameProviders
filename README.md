# FTQGameProviders

Mainly made for GOG Galaxy.

## Some answers to some questions

Is the application blocking game bar?
No, just blocking some xbox app features in game bar.

Is the application safe for online games?
I don't know. I just tested for singleplayer games, use with your own risk.

Is this a harmfull application?
It's open source just ask to the AI or some expert.

Is the application using connection for any server while monotoring?
No, I don't have money to afford this. If I had, I won't.

Are there any regular bugs?
Yes, there is a bug for steam required games, the app closing games too.

## Tips:

1. You can use secret command /devmode for modification of app. It's a debugging tool to understand xbox store's agressive behavior.
2. Steam and Epic Games are the launchers very easy to beat, but xbox app ise the though guy.
3. I tried to write the code more readable, I'm a junior, please understand in the start.

# Disclaimer

I won't accept any responsibilty, if someone try to use the app with modifying for an illegal purpose.
I just don't want to use other launchers in the background during the time I used GOG Galaxy.
